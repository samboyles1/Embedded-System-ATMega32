    @brief  Infrared serial receiver driver for Phillips RC5 protocol.
*/

/* The Phillips RC-5 protocol uses the following format of 14 bits:
   1 start bit
   1 field bit (this used to be a second start bit)
   1 toggle bit
   5 address bits
   6 command bits
 
   Manchester encoding is used for the bits.  The start bit is a `1' bits.
   `1' bits have the IR modulation on for the second half of the cycle.
   `0' bits have the IR modulation on for the first half of the cycle.

   Each bit period is 1778 microseconds (64 cycles of 36 kHz modulation)
   thus a frame is 24.9 ms.

   While a button is pressed, a frame is repeatedly sent.  If the button
   is repressed, the toggle bit is changed.

   This is a simple polled implementation that will block for the entire frame
   if it detects a start bit.
