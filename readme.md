// notes from lecture 9th oct
encouraged to use the API functions
    in /drivers and /utils
    
    do a #include "filename.h"

eg pio.h, system.h, tinygl.h

dont copy and paste code and pretend its yours, i.e if we want to use pio.h, must #include it not pretend we wrote it
will be marked on the code we write, not the code from the #includes
